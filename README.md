# StegoFolder
StegoFolder lets you securely hide and extract entire folders (with subfolders + files) inside PNG images using password protection. It includes both a beautiful macOS-style GUI built with PyQt5 ✨ and a CLI for automation ⚙️. Perfect for learning steganography, experimenting with data hiding, or building secure file workflows.
